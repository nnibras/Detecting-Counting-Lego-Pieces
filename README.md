# LEGO Detection with Mask R-CNN

This project provides a comprehensive setup for detecting LEGO pieces in images using Mask R-CNN. It includes scripts for training, evaluation, data processing, and an interactive interface powered by Gradio for testing the model.

## Project Overview

- **Model**: Mask R-CNN, configured for LEGO piece detection.
- **Features**:
  - Detects and counts LEGO pieces in uploaded images.
  - Provides bounding boxes and pseudo-masks to highlight detected objects.
  - Includes Gradio-based app interfaces for interactive usage.
  - Supports training, evaluation, and data processing.

## Setup Instructions
Download or Provide Model Weights
To run the Gradio app or perform evaluation, download the pretrained model weights (mask_rcnn_lego.pth) and place them in the project directory. This file contains the trained weights for detecting LEGO pieces.

Note: If you don’t have this model file, you may need to train it using train.py.

Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Processing
Link to Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dreamfactor/biggest-lego-dataset-600-parts

If your data annotations are in VOC format, you can convert them to COCO format using voc_to_coco.py:

python voc_to_coco.py

This will generate COCO format annotation files necessary for training the Mask R-CNN model.

You can also inspect and process data using data_processing.ipynb, which includes code for data exploration and format conversion.

## Training the Model
To train the Mask R-CNN model, use train.py. Ensure your data is organized and annotated in COCO format. Adjust the training hyperparameters in the script as needed.

python train.py

Training outputs include:
Updated model weights saved as mask_rcnn_lego.pth (or a specified filename).
Logs for monitoring loss and accuracy.

## Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the model using evaluate.py to see its performance on validation data.

python evaluate.py

Results include:
Evaluation metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU).
Visualizations that help interpret detection results.

## Running the Application
Launch the Gradio application using app.py:

python app.py
or
python app2.py

This will start a Gradio interface at a local address, where you can:
Upload Image: Select an image containing LEGO pieces.
View Results: The app displays:
Bounding boxes around each detected LEGO piece.
Pseudo-masks to highlight detected areas.
The count of detected LEGO pieces.
Alternatively, you can experiment with app2.py (which has the pseudomask).
